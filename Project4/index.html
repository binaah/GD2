                <h4>Hayley Akins</h4>
                <p>Hayley is the Founder of Motion Hatch, an online learning hub for motion designers and animators.
                    When Hayley
                    started freelancing as an animator she noticed a severe lack of information and support on how
                    to build a
                    successful motion design business. So she decided to do something about it!
                    Motion Hatch offers training, resources and a biweekly podcast discussing the business side of
                    motion
                    design. Hayley has been in the motion design industry for 10 years working with clients such as
                    The United
                    Nations, Gates Foundation, Google, and the BBC.
