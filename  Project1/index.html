        <p>To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an
            octopus
            pulling two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the
            shells together
            like nesting bowls — and carts them away.</p>

        <p class="question-block">“It suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some
            understanding they
            may be useful
            in the future,” said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the
            University of
            Cambridge in Britain.</p>

        <p>But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.</p>

        <p>For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them
            apes,
            elephants, dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots.</p>

        <p>But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes
            octopuses, squid
            and cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(18)30267-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0169534718302672%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">
                lack some hallmarks</a> of intelligence seen in other species.</p>
        <aside>
            <blockquote>“It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,”said Mr.
                Amodio.</blockquote>
        </aside>

        <p> He and five other experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month
            inthe
            journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution.</p>

        <p>For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or
            taking a car
            apart and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that
            help an
            animal thrive.</p>

        <p>That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for
            example, or a
            knack for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed
            responses to
            survive — they can invent new behaviors on the fly.</p>

        <p>To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/science/26obdolphin.html?module=inline">stick
                a sponge on its beak to avoid getting cuts</a> from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or
            they bring
            animals into the lab and offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/science/crows-toolmaking.html?module=inline">learn
                to rip paper into strips of just the right size.</a></p>

        <p>Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified
            some shared
            factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time,
            and they can
            form long-lasting social bonds.</p>
