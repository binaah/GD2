            After arriving in Orlando International Airport, I ate lunch with my travel mates and then went to premium
            outlet to shop. While we were shopping, we got what we wanted to buy before coming here and used ‘Uber’ app
            to go to hotel we already booked. We unpacked our room and went to a swimming pool in the hotel. We were not
            really hungry, so we chose to eat a kid meal that consisted small fries and chicken tenders. I slept earlier
            than usual, because we needed to get up earlier to watch ‘Harry Potter World’ in the Universal Studio’s
            famous place.
            I had to wake up earlier to prepare myself before going to the place, so I washed my face and brushed my
            teeth. Also, I did my makeup and I dressed up in different costumes. In addition to myself, there were
            others who spent time styling themselves. We checked to see if we had our passports, hotel key cards and
            ticket confirmation before we left. We used our hotel shuttle to get to Universals Studios and it took
            15minutes to reach there.

            The police checked our IDs and belongings after we arrived at Universals Studios parking garage. It took
            some time until we reached the entrance of the park. I could see palm trees and all types of nature that I
            hadn’t seen in Baltimore; and then finally we were there.

            I got in line at the entry for a long time and I visited the famous place called ‘the wizarding world of
            Harry Potter’. In Harry Potter land, there were two parts of the land and I went one of the parts called
            ‘Harry Potter and the escape Gringotts’.

            It was amazing for me to visit the ‘Harry Potter and the escape Gringotts’ since I could see the moving
            character figures, props such as moving pictures and newspaper, set and even sound effect that are same as
            the movies. Thus, I felt I was in Harry Potter land.

            When we finished seeing everything, I went to store selling butter beer which was a popular spot. I tried to
            drink the butter beer, its tasted more like combination of caramel flavored popcorn and coffee consisting of
            a lot of sugar.

            While we were drinking the butter beer, we looked around The Wizarding World of Harry Potter-Diagon Alley.
            In goods stores, there were many Harry Potter’s wands and capes that are similar in the movies.

            After completing the Harry potter’s valley, we looked around the street and beautiful stores. The weather
            was so nice; and I took many pictures in the street What surprised me was that there were some fake
            buildings there, and no people inside.

            I was starving because I did not get breakfast and it was afternoon. Therefore, I thought about which food I

            We went shopping in various character goods shops after eating lunch heartily. My favorite two goods store

            The simpsons is one of my favorite shows, so I enjoyed seeing the merchandise. I liked to buy some stuff in

            My travel mates and I ordered blue-berry and lemonade slush ice and got a rest on a bench. The weather was
            hotter than before and we needed to restore our energy, so we stayed there for a while.

            I really loved scary and exciting rides, so I decided to go the scariest roller coaster with my mates. I was
            thrilled by the roller coaster, since it went down in a 90-degree angle and then turned at an all-round
            angle.

            Before leaving the place, I was standing in front of Universal Studio globe to commemorate my visit in
            Orlando. The globe was very popular for people, so there were overloaded with people.

            We went to Mexican restaurant and chose steak, quesadilla, and burrito set for dinner. I think we were so
            hungry, we ate dinner without talking with each other. Then we went back to the hotel and shared and talked
            about our worries and favorite things in the Universal Studio Orlando. Also, we called our friends before we
            went to bed and I went to go outside. Then, I texted with my family, best friend and art teacher and talked
            about the day. I had gotten up earlier than my usual routine and used a lot of energy, so I was so tried and
            then I went to bed immediately.
            Today was interesting for me to spend time looking around and I thought I lived my life without regrets.
            Visiting the place did what I expected and when I was watching cute characters, I felt like a child again.
            Before coming to USA, I made my own bucket list and I achieved one goal of the list. This is because, I
            really wanted to go Universal studio in Orlando and Los Angles and I was very happy. Next time, I want to
            not only Disney Universal studio world and also another places I have never visited with other people. I
            recommend this place for people who love Disney characters and animations.
